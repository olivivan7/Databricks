# MAGIC # De-Duping Data
# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) Instructions
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this exercise, we're doing ETL on a file we've received from some customer. That file contains data about people, including:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * first, middle and last names
# MAGIC * gender
# MAGIC * birth date
# MAGIC * Social Security number
# MAGIC * salary
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC But, as is unfortunately common in data we get from this customer, the file contains some duplicate records. Worse:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * In some of the records, the names are mixed case (e.g., "Carol"), while in others, they are uppercase (e.g., "CAROL"). 
# MAGIC * The Social Security numbers aren't consistent, either. Some of them are hyphenated (e.g., "992-83-4829"), while others are missing hyphens ("992834829").
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The name fields are guaranteed to match, if you disregard character case, and the birth dates will also match. (The salaries will match, as well,
# MAGIC and the Social Security Numbers *would* match, if they were somehow put in the same format).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Your job is to remove the duplicate records. The specific requirements of your job are:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * Remove duplicates. It doesn't matter which record you keep; it only matters that you keep one of them.
# MAGIC * Preserve the data format of the columns. For example, if you write the first name column in all lower-case, you haven't met this requirement.
# MAGIC * Write the result as a Parquet file, as designated by *dest_file*.
# MAGIC * The final Parquet "file" must contain 8 part files (8 files ending in ".parquet").
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/icon_hint_24.png"/>&nbsp;**Hint:** The initial dataset contains 103,000 records.<br/>
# MAGIC The de-duplicated result haves 100,000 records.

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) Getting Started
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Run the following cell to configure our "classroom."

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run "../Includes/Classroom-Setup"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) Hints
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * Use the <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html" target="_blank">API docs</a>. Specifically, you might find 
# MAGIC   <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.html?highlight=dataframe#pyspark.sql.DataFrame" target="_blank">DataFrame</a> and
# MAGIC   <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql.html#functions" target="_blank">functions</a> to be helpful.
# MAGIC * It's helpful to look at the file first, so you can check the format. **`dbutils.fs.head()`** (or just **`%fs head`**) is a big help here.

# COMMAND ----------

# TODO

source_file = f"{datasets_dir}/dataframes/people-with-dups.txt"
dest_file = userhome + "/people.parquet"

# In case it already exists
dbutils.fs.rm(dest_file, True)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/curriculum-release/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) Validate Your Answer
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC At the bare minimum, we can verify that you wrote the parquet file out to **dest_file** and that you have the right number of records.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Running the following cell to confirm your result:

# COMMAND ----------

part_files = len(list(filter(lambda f: f.path.endswith(".parquet"), dbutils.fs.ls(dest_file))))

final_df = spark.read.parquet(dest_file)
final_count = final_df.count()

clearYourResults()
validateYourAnswer("01 Parquet File Exists", 1276280174, part_files)
validateYourAnswer("02 Expected 100000 Records", 972882115, final_count)
summarizeYourResults()
